Join the Sedaro Community [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sedaro-community/shared_invite/zt-1jps4i711-mXy88AZQ9AV7YcEXr8x7Ow) 2. Email us at support@sedarotech.com  ### Known Issues  - Currently the documentation for 200 responses to Block create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations is incorrect. This is due to an issue with our documentation generator.  Under each Block Group, the documentation will show `name`, `collection`, and `data` keys.  In reality, this level does not exist and should be skipped.  See the schema under the `data` key of a Template's Block Group for the correct schema of such Block Group. - Error responses are most specific than what is shown throughout the documentation.  A 4xx or 5xx error will be returned in all error cases.  Only a `200` status indicates success.  See a given error response for additional details.   # noqa: E501
